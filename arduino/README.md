# Core Reaktor
The LED poi Danny Thomas and Matt Terry worked on in 2010-2011

This Arduino library takes data from accelerometers, gyros and magnetometers, and calculates it's position and movement in 3d space.

The core provides many variables, like degrees around a circle, velocity in each direction, rotation around each axis, rate of change of each variable, rate of rate of change.... etc

Then there's a color library which uses RGB or HSL to push colors to the poi. It also has a system based on color theory which provides analogous, split complements, complements, triadic, etc
